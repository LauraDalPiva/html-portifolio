<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Laura Dal Piva Klein Ibing, and I hold a degree in Business Administration with an emphasis 
  in International Trade from UNOESC. I worked for over five years in the export sector, focusing on operational 
  processes, where I developed strong skills in organization, planning, and teamwork. During this time, I contributed 
  to process optimization and meeting deadlines in fast-paced, high-demand environments, which strengthened my adaptability, 
  problem-solving abilities, and results-oriented mindset.</p>

<p>In 2025, driven by a desire for new challenges and a growing interest in the digital world, I began a career transition 
  into the technology field. Since then, I have been fully dedicated to studying Web Development, combining my previous 
  professional experience with curiosity, discipline, and a passion for learning. I'm excited about this new journey and 
  actively seeking opportunities that will allow me to grow, contribute, and evolve within the tech industry.</p>
